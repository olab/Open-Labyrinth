# LEAP ORM for Kohana PHP Framework

LEAP is an ORM for the [Kohana PHP Framework](http://kohanaframework.org).  It also provides a powerful query builder.  More importantly, it
works with the following databases: DB2, Drizzle, Firebird, MariaDB, MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  This ORM has been completely built
from the ground up and therefore is NOT a hack implemetation.

The Leap ORM is based on the active record design pattern.  It provides a way to model database tables using PHP objects.

## Motivation

The Kohana PHP framework is one of the cleanest frameworks.  However, Kohana's official ORM is written only for MySQL.  Although some developers
have attempted to make it work with other databases, it really doesn't work well with any database other than MySQL.  Therefore, the primary goal
of this project was to create an ORM for Kohana that works with any major database.

Another goal of this project was to make the LEAP ORM a true Kohana module so that it could be just dropped into the Kohana's modules folder and
work.  Even though ORMs like [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm) could be adapted for Kohana, doing so requires a lot of work
to function correctly.  Besides, Doctrine is now so bloated and old that it really needs to be refactored.

A third goal for this project was to create an ORM for Kohana that can harness the power of composite keys, which many other ORMs (e.g. [Kohana's
official ORM](https://github.com/kohana/orm), [Jelly](https://github.com/creatoro/jelly), and [Sprig](https://github.com/sittercity/sprig/)) cannot
handle.  The LEAP ORM for Kohana, on the other hand, is able to load models using composite keys.

## Features

LEAP provides a number of features, such as:

* Plugins for DB2, Drizzle, Firebird, MariaDB, MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
* Designed to work in conjunction with other database tools for Kohana.
* [Config file for designating the database driver (e.g. PDO) and connection strings](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-database-connection/).
* Classes are easily extensible.
* A [database connection pool](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/establishing-a-database-connection/) for managing resources.
* A powerful [query builder for creating SQL statements](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/building-sql-statements/).
* Sanitizes data to help prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Capable of handling non-integers primary keys.
* Supports composite primary keys and composite foreign keys.
* Enforces strong data types on [database fields](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/mapping-a-model/#fields).
* Allows [field aliases](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/mapping-a-model/#aliases) to be declared.
* Makes working with certain database fields easy with [field adaptors](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/mapping-a-model/#adaptors).
* A toolkit of useful functions.
* [Leap's API](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/api/annotated.html) that documents each class.
* Lots of [tutorials](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/index/).

## Getting Started

To start using LEAP, follow these steps:

1. Just download the module from github.
2. Unzip the download to the modules folder in Kohana.
3. Rename the uncompressed folder to "leap".
4. Modify leap/config/database.php.
5. Add "leap" as a module to application/bootstrap.php.
6. Begin creating your models in the application/classes/model/leap/ folder.

For more information, see the tutorial on [installing LEAP](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/installing-leap/).

## Required Files

The LEAP ORM module is meant to be completely independent of other Kohana modules.  However, it is recommended that Kohana's database module be
installed as well so that you can utilize the Database_Expression class.  As for the files within LEAP, you can remove any database plugins that
you are not using.  This is possible because each database plugin in LEAP is considered independent of the others.

## Documentation

This project is accompanied by [a companion Web site](http://orm.spadefootcode.com), which documents the [API for the LEAP ORM](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/api/annotated.html)
and has a number of [examples and tutorials](http://orm.spadefootcode.com/tutorials/index/). You can also find other tutorials and examples
online (please let us know if you find one that we should highlight here).

## Further Assistance

Although LEAP is simple to use with the Kohana PHP Framework, you can get further assistance by asking questions on either [Kohana's Forum](http://forum.kohanaframework.org/)
or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverlow.com). You can also send an email to spadefoot.oss@gmail.com.
