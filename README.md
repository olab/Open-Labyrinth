OpenLabyrinth
==============
OpenLabyrinth is an open-source (GNU-GPL3 licence) platform for creating and playing virtual patients. 

For more information about OpenLabyrinth generally, see http://openlabyrinth.ca

You do not need any software to play a case. Any modern web browser will work. If you want to try authoring your own cases,
OpenLabryinth can be installed on a basic web server running Apache, MySQL, and PHP (eg a LAMP, WAMP setup etc.)

The install routines are still a bit glitchy - we apologize for this. Linux experts should have no trouble. The rest of us 
mortals might have a hiccup or two.

If you want to see some of the latest development features, send us a note via info AT openlabyrinth DOT ca and we can set 
you up with a test account at http://demo.openlabyrinth.ca/
